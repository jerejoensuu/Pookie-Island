  - Oh, you startled me! Where did you come from?
  - You came from another world, is that right? Well, lucky for you, I've been around
    for a while, so I'd be happy to be to be your guide.
  - 'First things first, let me tell you a little bit about our world. Our world
    consists of 3 islands. '
  - 'The main Island is probably where you wanna go from here, it''s the home of
    my people. '
  - 'The other islands, well... They''re mostly populated by what we call "Pookies". '
  - There are three different elemental types, plus a hard headed one that's really
    good at breaking stuff.
  - There are also lots of valuable crystals scattered around the islands. Maybe
    you can make use of the Pookies' powers to collect some of those crystals!
  - Also did you see that golden gem? We call them shards, cause they're broken pieces
    of crystals that lost their power..
  - It is said that when you gather many shards together, they'll fuse and create
    a brand new crystal!
  - Amazing, right?! Right?! Sorry I get too excited about shards, but they're just
    so cool!
  - 'OK, let me tell you how you can make use of that tool of yours in this world. '
  - WASD - Move
  - Space - Jump
  - Ctrl - Roll
  - Right Mouse Button - Vacuum In
  - 'Left Mouse Button - Use '
  - Q - Release Pookie / Held Item
