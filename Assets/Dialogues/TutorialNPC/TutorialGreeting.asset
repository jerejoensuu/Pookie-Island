  - Oh, you startled me! Where did you come from?
  - You came from another world, is that right? Well, lucky for you, I've been around
    for a while, so I'd be happy to be to be your guide.
  - 'First things first, let me tell you a little bit about our world. Our world
    consists of 3 islands. '
  - 'The main Island is probably where you wanna go from here, it''s the home of
    my people. '
  - 'The other islands, well... They''re mostly populated by what we call "Pookies". '
  - There are three different elemental types, plus a hard headed one that's really
    good at breaking stuff.
  - There are also lots of valuable crystals scattered around the islands. Maybe
    you can make use of the Pookies' powers to collect some of those crystals!
  - 'I''ll quickly show you how you can make use of that tool of yours in this world. '
