  - Hey, you finally reached me! I've seen your spaceship crash, sad stuff mate.
  - Me? Oh some people around call me a hermit cause I don't live down there, but
    here's a better place to watch over them!
  - Especially over Baba, the farmer downhill. I've always had a crush on her, I'll
    admit..
  - She looked in a pickle this morning.. This sad pout under her hat breaks my froggy
    heart.
  - I'm too shy to help her myself, but could you go check on her and help with the
    farm?
  - 'You''re in for a *shiny* treat if you make Baba smile again: my shard stash
    uphill will be all yours!'
