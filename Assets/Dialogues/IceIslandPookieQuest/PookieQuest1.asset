  - Oh hi ! Haven't seen your type around before... Nice to meet you, I'm Icy the
    Ice Pookie and I'm waiting for my friends...
  - As you can see, there's a huge snowstorm right now which makes it hard to see
    anything on the island, but since you have a nice sturdy helmet, could you go
    find my friends for me ? I promise I'll reward you !
